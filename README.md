# Privacy Policy

## Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains how the Tidal CLI application ("the Application") collects, uses, and protects user data. By using the Application, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy. This policy may be updated periodically to reflect changes in practices or regulations.

## Data Collected
The Application may collect the following data:

1. **Authentication Tokens**: The Application retrieves and uses OAuth tokens to authenticate with the Tidal API.
2. **User Preferences**: Configuration settings, such as default country codes or playback preferences, may be stored locally.

## Data Usage
The Application uses collected data exclusively to:

1. Authenticate and interact with the Tidal API.
2. Provide the functionality of the Application, such as accessing user playlists or streaming music.

## Data Storage
- **Local Storage**: Any data, including authentication tokens or user preferences, is stored locally on the user's device.
- **No Third-Party Sharing**: The Application does not send user data to any third party or external servers.

## Data Security
We take reasonable measures to protect user data:
- Tokens and sensitive information are encrypted when stored locally.
- The Application does not retain data longer than necessary for its functionality.

## User Responsibilities
Users are responsible for:
- Keeping their authentication tokens secure.
- Logging out or removing stored tokens if they share their device.

## Third-Party APIs
The Application interacts with the Tidal API. Users should review Tidal’s Privacy Policy to understand how their data is handled by Tidal’s services.

## Changes to This Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated. Users will be informed of changes through the Application’s documentation or update notes. Continued use of the Application constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
